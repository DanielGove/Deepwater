## Components Used

| Component          | Location                          | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Global Registry** | `registry.bin` (disk) + shm mmap | Stores the list of all feeds, their IDs, paths, and flags (e.g., persistable). |
| **Feed Registry**   | `feed_registry.bin` per feed     | Tracks chunks for a specific feed: metadata, index filenames, shm names, etc. |
| **Chunk Data**      | `/dev/shm/` or `.data` file      | Raw binary stream of trades or events for a specific time window. |
| **Chunk Index**     | `/dev/shm/` or `.idx` file       | Index metadata for locating or seeking within the chunk. |
| **Locks**           | `/tmp/` lockfiles                | Ensure one writer modifies global registry at a time. Feed writers are assumed unique for now. |

## üîÑ Story Flow

### 1. Writer Process Starts

- Tries to attach to the **global registry** via shared memory.
- If the shm does not exist, loads `registry.bin` from disk and memory-maps it.
- Registry structure includes: feed ID ‚Üí feed name, storage path, flags (e.g., `persist: true`), etc.

---

### 2. Feed Lookup

- Writer searches global registry for its feed name (e.g., `coinbase-BTC-USD`).
- If feed exists, proceeds to attach to the **feed registry**.
- If not, it must acquire the global registry **write lock**.

---

### 3. Feed Registration

- Acquires exclusive lock on `/tmp/deepwater.global_registry.lock`.
- Appends feed metadata to the registry in shared memory.
- Writes updated registry back to `registry.bin`.
- Releases the lock.

---

### 4. Feed Registry Initialization

- If feed already existed:
  - Loads `feed_registry.bin` from disk.
  - Memory-maps it for shared access.
- If feed is new:
  - Creates `feed_registry.bin` from scratch.
  - Initializes shared memory mapping.

---

### 5. Chunk Creation and Writing

- Consults feed registry to find the latest chunk.
- **Always creates a new chunk** (to avoid overwriting anything).
- Allocates:
  - `chunk_<N>.data` in shm
  - `chunk_<N>.idx` in shm
- Writes live event data to the chunk.
- Updates the feed registry with chunk metadata and offsets in real-time.

---

### 6. Chunk Rotation and Cleanup

When the active chunk is full or aged out:

1. **Create new shm chunk** and begin writing to it.
2. If feed is marked `persist: true` in global registry:
   - Spawn a background thread or subprocess to:
     - Flush chunk `.data` and `.idx` to disk (non-blocking).
     - Update the feed registry with final state.
3. If chunk is **outside the live window**:
   - After flush completes, **unlink the shm segments**.
   - Ensure feed registry points only to valid, existing chunks.

---

### 7. Writer Shutdown

Upon shutdown:

1. Flush live chunk to disk (if required by settings).
2. Write final feed registry state to disk.
3. **Unlink all shm segments** (feed registry and chunks).
4. Exit cleanly.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The global registry and disk-based files **must not** be unlinked unless intentionally cleaning up the system.

## üîê Locking Summary

| Resource           | Lock Type        | Notes |
|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| Global Registry    | Exclusive lock (`/tmp/deepwater.global_registry.lock`) | Used when appending a new feed. |
| Feed Registry      | None (for now)   | Writers are assumed unique. Reader safety depends on append-only logic. |
| Chunk Index/Data   | None (one-writer) | Only the owning writer writes. Readers access via offset/version metadata. |

---

## üß† Key Principles

- Global registry is the **source of truth** for all feed paths and metadata.
- All registries and chunks are **memory-mapped** and optionally persisted.
- Flushes and unlinks are **non-blocking** and decoupled from the hot path.
- Writers are **responsible** for:
  - Creating shm blocks
  - Writing feed/registry metadata
  - Cleaning up their own shm resources on shutdown
